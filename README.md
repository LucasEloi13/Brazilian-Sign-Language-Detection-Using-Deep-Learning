# TLIBRAS

This project is about a sign language recognition model using Python.


### Step taken

The project is still in development, see below for the list of planned steps and their completion status: 

- [x] Detect Face, Hand and Pose Landmarks
- [x] Extract Keypoints
- [x] Setup Folders for Data Collection
- [x] Collect Keypoint Sequences
- [ ] Preprocess Data and Create Labels
- [ ] Build and Train an LSTM Deep Learning Model
- [ ] Make Sign Language Predictions


## ðŸš€ Run Locally

To run the project, use:
```
<git clone https://github.com/LucasEloi13/TLIBRAS.git>
```
and 
```
<!pip install tensorflow==2.4.1 tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1 opencv-python mediapipe sklearn matplotlib> 
```
to install the dependencies (the python version used was 3.7).
